# Python-for-Data-Science
I am scripteing my journey of learning Python for Data Science. The guide is very much relatable for beginners and specially to people from the non-tech backgrounds. Since I am one! I have seen many students, freshers and anyone trying to get into this field struggling understanding the very basics concepts. I may be a frsher aas well but I try to put in my efoorts to develop and understand each line of code written here. I hope someday someone will get something out of it hopefully. Help youself to copy, use and do whatever you like. All the Very Best!
